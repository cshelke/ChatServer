# Chat_server
This is a Chat server which supports multiple users chatting with each other.
The only argument required is the port number on which you want the server to listed to.

So you can run it this way:
> java Server <portno>

I have deployed an instance of the server on my AWS running on port 49129
You can use multiple instances of the clients to access the chat rooms of this server.
More about the client in the Chat_client repository.
